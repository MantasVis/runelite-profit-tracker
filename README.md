For example, if you are filling vials, the plugin will accumlate profit each time you fill vial, accounting for empty vials price in GE.
Depositing or withdrawing items will not affect profit value.


# Gold drops
Every change in your inventory is monitored and a corresponding profit animation will be shown.

For example, if you buy in a general shop, an item for 20 coins, which is worth in GE 220 coins,
ProfitTracker will generate a gold drop animation of 200 coins.
